#War-For-Freedom
This is a project similar to Advance Wars. It is for my term project in 112.
I am using CMU Graphics and I will create my own sprites. I will use Asperite for the sprite creation. 
The goal of the project is to destroy the enemy's base through a turn-based grid. There are 3 kinds of units and you can move them in different ways. Light units are essentially ninjas who can move quite far across the board but have very low health and deal low damage. 
Medium Units are essentially regular soldiers who can move a normal amount of distance and deal a regular(50) damage. 
There are then heavy units that deal a ton of damage and are very tanky but move very slowly.
You win if there are no units on the board or the base is destroyed.
